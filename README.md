##About Plate it Forward:

Plate it Forward (PIF) is a mobile-responsive web application that tackles hunger and food waste in Albuquerque, NM. We partner with local restaurants and community centers to provide free meals (restaurant leftovers) to those in need.

PIF was designed so hungry New Mexicans can easily find a participating community center near them thanks to a dynamic map with geo markers and a complete directory listing. Community centers and restaurants, through user profiles, can input their donation (restaurants) and served (community center) data to help us track their philanthropic effort and impact.


##How PIF Works:

Community centers partner with local restaurants (created by partnership requests in their user profiles – like friend requests on social media)
Restaurants package up their leftovers from the day in pre-portioned to-go containers
Leftovers are brought to their partnering community center
The community center serves those meals to the public


##Why We Do What We Do:

Created in 2022 in response to rising grocery prices and noticeable restaurant food waste, we wanted to give New Mexicans safe and reliable access to quality meals without the limitations of city programs or soup kitchens.

Our program is for anyone experiencing hunger regardless of their situation – no explanation, identification, or proof of income required. Life is difficult enough, and finding and enjoying a meal shouldn’t be.


##Access Information:

All community center and restaurant information you see in our recorded demo is local to our machines and IPs. To fork our repository and have PIF on your device, run our statements.sql file – be mindful of the partnership UUIDs because those will change when you run the tables in our project.sql file.


##About Us (the Developers):

We’re all recent graduates of Central New Mexico Community College: CNM Ingenuity: Deep Dive Coding’s Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp and the brains behind PIF. You can learn more about us (and find our emails) below!

- Alex Mostaghni (amostaghni@cnm.edu): “As a former nonprofit events and donor relations professional turned developer, Plate it Forward is a perfect combination of my skills and passions. Coding makes me feel like a superhero, and I’m excited to use and strengthen these powers to make a difference in my community.

- Erin Ruiz (eruiz24@cnm.edu): “I’m a self taught graphic designer and a UX/UI Design enthusiast, which prompted my desire to learn more about web design and development. It was very rewarding to apply my prior experience and love of design to Plate it Forward as I was learning and developing a new set of skills.”

- Sergio Salas (ssalas28@cnm.edu): “I’m an upbeat, consistent team player who values communication, and levity, maintaining high spirits during the eventual panic in building web applications. From an early age, I’ve worked with technology and understanding how it works. This experience has given me an extensive skill set in computer hardware and troubleshooting, which I've translated to aid in tackling the complexity of Plate it Forward.”


**Disclaimer: PIF is not a real organization or program. Community centers and restaurants listed on our application are for demo purposes only; however, it’s our goal to turn this into a real opportunity!

<p><b>Frustrations and Needs: </b>Cori believes community-led events and businesses are the future. She likes to absorb as much information about what is happening around the city as possible. She is frustrated by the little support or understanding of community within her organization, so she researches new opportunities for outreach on her own.</p>
<p><b>Goals: </b>Cori wants to find restaurants that can donate food to provide for a new free lunch program at the community center. She wants to connect with restaurants in the same neighborhood, so it will be easy for donation deliver or pickup.</p>
<p><b>User-story:</b> "As a user, I want to find restaurants, in the same neighborhood as the community center, that would be willing to donate food for a new adult/family free lunch program that I am starting."</p>
